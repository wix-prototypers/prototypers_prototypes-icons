# prototypers_prototypes-icons
This Project helps us to add icons from different libraries in wix to our prototypes easily and conveniently

### How to Use?
1. Copy the relevant CSS link (CDN link) to your prototype project:
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wix-prototypers/prototypers_prototypes-icons@1.1/src/prototypes-icons.css
```

2. When adding iccon to the prototype, we need to use the <code><i></i></code> element. This element gets the attribute: data-icon and its value will include the library of the icon and its name.
